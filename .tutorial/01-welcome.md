# Build a Recommendation System using Weaviate

Welcome to this Build with Weaviate episode where we create a simple recommendation system. 

## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will build a simple recommendation system using Weaviate, a purpose-built vector database. Recommendation systems have become an essential component of many online applications and services in today's digital age. From personalized product recommendations to content suggestions, these systems help users discover new things and make informed decisions.

## Overview
We will perform the following steps:
1. Create an instance of a Weaviate cluster to get our vector database.
2. Populate it with about 7000 books from a Kaggle dataset.
3. Connect to a Large Language Model hosted on OpenAI.
4. Build a NextJS application to do semantic search over our dataset.

## Let’s Try It Out!
Before we dive into building, let’s see what we’re aiming for! Head on over to the deployed URL and type in something you want to learn. The books that are surfaced should contain relevant suggestions based on your query.
