## Setting Up the NextJS Application

### Project Creation and Configuration
I used `create-next-app` to create the NextJS project and configured TailwindCSS from the start for styling.

### Application Interface
The application interface is kept as simple as possible to limit complexity:

1. **Input Field**: To receive the prompt from the user.
2. **Grid View**: To show recommended books.
3. **Modal Overlay**: Acts as a single book view where we can read the description and book details.
