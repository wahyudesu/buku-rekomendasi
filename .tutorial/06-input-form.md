## Application Interface Breakdown

### JSX Structure
The JSX for the application contains a form element, which includes a submission button and an input element with various attributes.

1. **Input Field**: This is the most interesting part as it receives the user's input. We store that in the `value` attribute as `query`. This `query` variable is a state managed at the top of the `index.js`. When the text in the input field changes, the `setQuery` function is triggered, and the `query` state is updated. This is standard React functionality. If this is new to you, consider taking a course in React / NextJS for a better understanding.
   
2. **Styling**: There are also some class tags that style the input field through the power of TailwindCSS.

3. **Form Submission**: The form element has an `onSubmit` event that triggers a function called `getRecommendations` when the submission button is clicked.

### getRecommendations Function
Let's take a look at the `getRecommendations` function:

1. **Validation**: It starts with some lightweight validation to ensure the user has actually typed something into the input field.
   
2. **API Request**: Then we trigger a fetch call against `/api/recommendations`.
   
3. **Extracting Book Data**: Once we receive a response, we extract the book data from the payload. As seen in the Python search example, we know we can get the book data from `recommendations.data.Get.Book`, and we store it in a state variable.

With this, we have the book recommendations data in our NextJS client application.
