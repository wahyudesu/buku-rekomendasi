## Conclusion

That's all there really is to using Weaviate to create a simple recommendation system in a NextJS application. 

### Demo
Let's put in a simple query like "I want to learn about basketball" and see what we get. This is awesome! We have several books related to Basketball, as expected, and when we click 'Learn More', we get the modal view for our book.

### Recap
With just the logic you've seen in this video, we can create a fairly simple, yet robust recommendation system using Weaviate's vector database.
